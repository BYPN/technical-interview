# technical-interview

This is the code you will need for the technical part of BYP's engineering recruitment process.

## Set up

You will need the following installed on your machine:

- NodeJs and npm ([Instructions](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm))
- Mocha ([More information](https://mochajs.org/))

Clone this repository on to your local machine and run `npm i` to install mocha.

Run `npm test` to run the mocha tests. Two tests should pass.

## Sharing a session on VSCode

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) has a feature called "Live Share" which allows you to share your workspace. If you can, please set this up [using these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/liveshare/quickstart/share). If you do not or can not use VSCode, we will use a video call to share/present your screen instead.
